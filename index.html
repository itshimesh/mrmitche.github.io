<p>Welcome! This page has a quick outline of some of projects.

<h3>Slack Thesaurus Bot</h3>
<b>Problem: </b>When writing for a news website, I often found myself opening additional tabs to search for synonyms to avoid repeating descriptive words. In Chrome, opening extra tabs clogs up your RAM and slows your computer down. This was particularly annoying on my old laptop.

<br><b>Solution: </b>The news website has a Slack group for the writers, which we already keep open. Create a Slack bot to perform synonym searches in the same tab as writers chat.

<br><b>Tools used: </b>Python, pip, virtualenv, Slack API, slackclient, PyDictionary

<h3>Custom RSS Replacement</h3>
<b>Problem: </b>In my spare time, I review board games. The Indie Game Alliance maintains a page of designers looking to get their game reviewed. There is no way to tell how long the games have been on the list and if they still need reviews. Normally, I could add the site's RSS feed to my RSS reader and monitor for new games that way. Unfortunately the site is not RSS friendly.
<br><b>Solution: </b>Use Python web scraping to pull a list of games on the page and compare to previous list of games. If any games are added, notify me of game title and automatically open the website.
<br><b>Tools used: </b>Python, batch
